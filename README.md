# Tokyo-Olympics-Azure-Data-Engineering-Project
The main objective is to ingest raw Olympic data, perform transformations to generate meaningful insights, and analyze the processed data using Azure Synapse Analytics. This project demonstrates the real-world application of cloud-based data engineering tools to handle large-scale structured data efficiently.
Hereâ€™s the professional version of that content without emojis and with a formal tone, suitable for a GitHub README or your resume:

### Key Features

- **Data Ingestion**: Utilized Azure Data Factory (ADF) to ingest raw CSV files from Azure Blob Storage.
- **Data Transformation**: Applied data cleaning and transformation operations in Azure Databricks, implementing a medallion architecture with Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.
- **Data Storage**: Stored raw and processed data efficiently in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 for scalable access.
- **Data Analysis**: Performed data analysis using SQL queries within Azure Synapse Analytics to generate actionable insights.
- **Modular Architecture**: Designed a modular, scalable architecture that reflects modern data engineering best practices for enterprise-ready solutions.
